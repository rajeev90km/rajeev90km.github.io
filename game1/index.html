			<ul>
				<li>The player controls the position of the main character with the arrow keys.</li>
				<li>The player has 2 characteristics: health and body temperature. Both keep decreasing steadily.</li>
				<li>The objective of the game is to stay warm and healthy for as long as possible. If either of the 2 characteristics reaches zero, the player dies.</li>
				<li>The player is equipped with an axe. Use <strong>X</strong> to use the axe to cut trees or to attack the wild animals.</li>
				<li>Once you chop trees, the player gets lumber. Use <strong>F</strong> to start a fire for a while using the obtained lumber . Fire increases body temperature a bit.</li>
				<li>Wild Animals can attack you when you get close to them. Once you kill them using the axe, press <strong>E</strong> to eat the meat. This increases health a bit</li>
				<li>Once you get lumber/meat, you can press <strong>C</strong> to carry them with you. Carry it to the wizard at the end of the forest to trade it for warm clothing(temperature drops slowly for a while)/replenish health(restore 75% of health).</li>
				<li>Trees once cut, will grow back at a slow rate.</li>
			</ul>
