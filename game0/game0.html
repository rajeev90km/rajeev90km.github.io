			Color Slide is played on a single screen. The player controls the horizontal position of the base by sliding it with the mouse. Neutralize a colored missile by making it land on the base unit with the same color.

			The player can slide the base unit left and right using the mouse to make sure the missile hits the right color. The missile is neutralized if it hits the same colored unit. If not, the unit's power is reduced by a third. As the score increases, the speed of the missiles increase. If any missile hits the ground, the game ends and high score is displayed.
